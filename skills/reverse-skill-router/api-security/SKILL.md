# API Security Testing

## ACTION REQUIRED (execute immediately after reading)

1. `NOW`: Read `../field-journal/precedent-pentest.md` — confirm this skill's operations are pre-authorized routine operations
2. `NOW`: Confirm whether the current task falls within this skill's scope
3. `NEXT`: Read `../tool-index.md`, validate tool availability and actual paths
4. `NEXT`: If tools are missing, invoke bootstrap — do not guess paths
5. `ACT`: Enter step one of the "Workflow" and execute; do not stop at a confirmation state

> Covers REST / GraphQL / WebSocket / SOAP, the full protocol set
> 10-phase methodology, from discovery to CI/CD integration

## Applicable Scenarios

- REST API security testing (OpenAPI/Swagger-driven or blind)
- GraphQL security auditing (introspection, batch queries, alias overload)
- WebSocket security testing
- JWT / OAuth 2.0 authentication testing
- BOLA/IDOR/BFLA authorization vulnerability detection
- API rate-limit bypass and DoS testing

## 10-Phase Testing Process

### Phase 1: API Discovery and Reconnaissance

```text
Active discovery:
□ Vespasian: headless browser crawl → auto-generate OpenAPI 3.0 / GraphQL SDL specs
□ Entropy --discover: extract endpoints from robots.txt + JS files
□ Kiterunner / ffuf: brute-force undocumented endpoint paths
□ Check common paths: /swagger.json, /openapi.json, /graphql, /api-docs

GraphQL introspection (three-tier attempt):
  1. Standard introspection query
  2. Minified query (bypasses WAF full-block rules)
  3. Query only __schema { types { name } } (minimal probe)
```

### Phase 2: Authentication Testing

```text
JWT analysis (jwt_tool / Burp):
□ alg:none attack: change the header to "alg":"none", clear the signature
□ Key confusion: RS256 public key → HS256 symmetric key
□ Weak HMAC key brute-force: jwt_tool -C -d wordlist.txt
□ Expiry/claim tampering: modify exp/iat/sub/role claims
□ kid injection: ../../etc/passwd → HMAC signature bypass

OAuth 2.0:
□ redirect_uri manipulation → authorization code leak
□ CSRF via missing state parameter
□ Token leaked in Referer header
□ PKCE missing detection

GraphQL authentication:
□ mutation via GET request bypassing authentication (CSRF)
□ Batch query authentication bypass
```

### Phase 3: Authorization Testing (BOLA/IDOR/BFLA)

```text
BOLA (object-level authorization bypass):
□ Iterate numeric IDs: /user/1 → /user/2 → /user/3
□ Iterate UUIDs
□ Iterate usernames/emails
□ Burp Autorize: dual-session replay comparison

BFLA (function-level authorization bypass):
□ Regular user invoking admin APIs
□ HTTP method switching: GET → PUT → PATCH → DELETE
□ API version downgrade: /v2/admin → /v1/admin
□ Bulk operation injection: {"users": [1,2,3]} → {"users": [1,2,3,admin_id]}

Tools: Burp Autorize, AuthMatrix, Entropy (malicious_insider persona)
```

### Phase 4: GraphQL-Specific

```text
Introspection leak → information exposure detection
Alias overload → 100+ aliases DoS
Batch queries → 10+ simultaneous queries DoS
Field repetition → __typename × 500
Directive overload → recursive @skip/@include
Circular queries → deeply nested introspection recursion
Field suggestions → error message information leak
GraphiQL/Playground exposure → public IDE risk
GET mutations → CSRF risk
Tracing/debug mode → metadata leak

Tools: FireTail, Escape DAST, api.sh (Phases 1-3)
```

### Phase 5: REST Input Validation

```text
□ HTTP method switching: GET→POST→PUT→DELETE→OPTIONS→PATCH
□ Content-Type tampering: JSON→XML→multipart
□ NoSQL injection: {"username": {"$gt": ""}}
□ SSRF via URL parameters: webhook URL/avatar URL/import URL
□ XXE in XML endpoints
□ Parameter pollution: /api?role=user&role=admin
□ Mass assignment: add is_admin: true to the request body
```

### Phase 6: Business Logic and Differential Testing

```text
□ Entropy compare: diff v1 vs v2 API → status code changes/field removal/latency regressions
□ Multi-role workflow testing: admin/user/readonly permission matrix
□ Coupon/points/price manipulation
□ Race conditions: concurrent request TOCTOU testing
```

### Phase 7: WebSocket Testing

```text
□ Endpoint discovery
□ Message injection (payload injection, prototype pollution)
□ Oversized message handling
□ Type confusion
□ Cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWH)
```

### Phase 8: Rate Limiting and DoS

```text
□ Rate-limit bypass via headers: X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP
□ Path variants: /api/ → /api → /Api/ → /API/
□ Slowloris low-bandwidth exhaustion
□ GraphQL batch query deep-nesting DoS
□ IP rotation testing (ProxyCat proxy pool)
```

### Phase 9: Data Exposure

```text
□ Excessive response exposure: compare API returns vs UI display
□ Pagination enumeration: ?page=1&limit=10000
□ Error message information leaks: stack traces/internal paths/SQL errors
□ GraphQL nested traversal accessing out-of-privilege data
□ OpenAPI spec exposing sensitive endpoints
```

### Phase 10: CI/CD Integration

```text
□ Entropy --ci --watch: auto-rerun on spec changes
□ Escape DAST: auto-block builds on severity thresholds
□ Findings persisted as regression tests
□ StackHawk (developer-first, ZAP core)
```

## Task Completion Self-Check (MUST pass before claiming completion)

- [ ] Did I execute every step of the workflow (rather than just reading it)?
- [ ] Did I use real tool paths based on `tool-index`?
- [ ] Did I produce reproducible evidence (commands/scripts/screenshots/reports)?
- [ ] Did I complete and write back the Checklist items required by RULES?
